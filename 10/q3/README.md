Q3
==========================================
Assume we have `6` virtual memory pages and 4 physical memory pages
and are using a _least-recently-used_ (LRU) replacement strategy.

What will happen if these virtual memory pages were accessed?

```
5 3 5 3 0 1 2 2 3 5
```

Time to visit the much loved Google Sheets!
