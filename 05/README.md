- Start early.
- Use `$s` registers for local variables.
- Don't forget to commit (using `git`) after each subset is working correctly! 
	- also good idea to `give` after completing each subset.
- Check that you are calculating the correct memory address.
- Skip sections of code using `j` instruction.
