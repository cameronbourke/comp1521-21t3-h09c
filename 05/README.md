[ ] 💻 [Assignment #1 Overview](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1521/21T3/assignments/ass1/index.html)

- Start early.
- First get comfortable with reference `C` implementation.
	- play around with `./minesweeper`!
- Take a look at all the constants before getting started!
- Implement what the `C` code does verbatim. Don't try and optimise!
- Use `$s` registers for all local variables.
- Don't forget to commit (using `git`) after each subset is working correctly! 
	- also good idea to `give` after completing each subset.
- Check that you are calculating the correct memory address.
- Skip sections of code using `j` instruction.
