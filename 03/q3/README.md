Q3
==========================================

We'll come back to this if we get time!

But! It's time for a trick ðŸ¤¹ 

If we need to convert to octal, we can do
a similar trick that we do for hex.

If we have the decimal number 10000.

In binary that is:

0b 0010 0111 0001 0000

In hex we can assign a digit to each nibble. So

0b 0010 0111 0001 0000
    0x2  0x7  0x1  0x0 = 0x2710

But! A little re-arranging, and we have:

0b 010 011 100 010 000
     2   3   4   2   0 = 023420
