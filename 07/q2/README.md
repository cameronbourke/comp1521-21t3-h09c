Q2
==========================================

Give MIPS directives to represent the following variables:

```c
...
f. int v5[20];
g. int v6[10][5];
h. struct { int x; int y; } v7;
i. struct { int x; int y; } v8[4];
j. struct { int x; int y; } *v9[4];
```

Assume that we are placing the variables in memory,
at an appropriately aligned address, and with
a label which is the same as the C variable name.
