Q6-8
==========================================

ğŸ‘† You get a program! ğŸ‘‡ You get a program!
ğŸ‘‰ You all get a program!

Imagine someone from a land, far, far away
has come to us and asked if we could help
implement a program that will prefix
each line of a given file and append
it to the end of another given file ğŸ‘½.

In other words, they want:

```bash
./read_from <filename> | ./add_prefix <prefix> | ./append_to <filename>
```

Hang on! What are those `|` looking things up there? Pipes!
Lucky for us, as long as each individual program does its job
correctly, we do not need to worry about the pipes (_until next week_).

Here's the plan. We are going to break up into
three groups. Each group will implement one of the following programs:
- `read_from`
- `add_prefix`
- `append_to`

Once everyone is finished, we'll come back in and see
if it is true, that the whole _is_ the sum of the parts.

Before, we get started, let's feast our eyes on
a reference implementation that we is lying around
to get a feel for how this should work ğŸ‘€.

> See ./demo

Lastly, let's quickly run over how to use [replit.com](replit.com).

Let's start the breakout rooms! (~10mins âŒ›)

I'll send you the link once you are in there ğŸ”—
